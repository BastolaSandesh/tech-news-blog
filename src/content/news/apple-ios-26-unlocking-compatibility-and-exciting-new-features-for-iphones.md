As the highly anticipated iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 prepare to launch this fall, Apple enthusiasts are eagerly awaiting the significant upgrades that will revolutionize their iPhone and iPad experiences. One of the most striking features of the new operating systems is the visual update, known as Liquid Glass, which promises to deliver a sleek and modern aesthetic. For those who cannot wait to get their hands on the new software, the public beta 2 is now available for download and installation. This version offers a more stable experience compared to the developer beta, which has recently reached beta 6, and includes several flashy features that are not yet available in the public version.

While the public beta is open to everyone and is considered stable, it is essential to remember that beta software carries a degree of risk. Additionally, rumors suggest that iOS 26 may introduce a groundbreaking live translation feature for AirPods, further enhancing the overall user experience. For those who are not planning to upgrade their devices this year, it is crucial to determine whether their current iPhone or iPad will be compatible with the new operating system.

In contrast to last year, when no iPhones were removed from the eligibility list, this year's update will leave behind some older models. The iPhone 8 models and iPhone X were the last to be discontinued in 2023, and now the 2018 models will no longer be supported. If you own an ineligible device, you will not be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall. To help you navigate the compatibility landscape, we will explore which iPhones and iPads will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 this year.


Key takeaways:
- The public beta 2 of iOS 26 is now available for download and installation, offering a more stable experience and new features.
- The new operating system will introduce a visual update called Liquid Glass, as well as potential live translation features for AirPods.
- Certain older iPhone models, including the 2018 models, will no longer be supported by iOS 26, making it essential to check compatibility before the official launch.
