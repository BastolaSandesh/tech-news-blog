Apple's highly anticipated iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 are set to revolutionize the iPhone and iPad experience this fall. One of the most striking features of the new operating systems is the visual update, known as Liquid Glass, which promises to elevate the user interface to new heights. For those eager to get a sneak peek, the public beta 2 is now available for download and installation. This version offers a more stable experience compared to the developer beta, which has already reached beta 6, and includes additional features not yet available in the public version. However, as with any beta software, users should be aware of the potential risks involved.

Rumors are also circulating about a new live translation feature that could be coming to AirPods with iOS 26. This exciting development could further enhance the overall Apple ecosystem experience. For those who are not planning to upgrade their devices this year, it's essential to check if their current iPhone or iPad will be compatible with the new operating system. Unfortunately, not all devices will make the cut, as Apple has decided to drop support for certain models. The iPhone 8 and iPhone X were the last to be discontinued in 2023, and this year, the 2018 models will no longer be supported.

To determine which iPhones and iPads will be compatible with iOS 26 and iPadOS 26, users can check Apple's official website for the list of supported devices. It's crucial to note that devices not on this list will not be able to download and install the new operating system when it becomes available this fall. With the public beta 2 now available, users can test-drive the new features and experience the future of Apple's operating systems.


Key takeaways:
- iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 will bring significant upgrades to the iPhone and iPad experience, including a new visual update called Liquid Glass.
- The public beta 2 is now available for download and installation, offering a more stable experience and additional features not yet available in the public version.
- Certain iPhone models, including the 2018 models, will no longer be supported by iOS 26, so users should check Apple's official website to see if their device is compatible.
