A growing wave of zero-day exploits is prompting urgent advisories from security vendors and national CERTs. Attackers are increasingly chaining logic flaws with privilege escalation bugs to achieve persistent access.

Recommended actions:

1. Enable automatic updates for critical platforms and browsers
2. Enforce least-privilege access and MFA everywhere
3. Roll out rapid detection rules for newly disclosed IOCs

The bottom line: Patch velocity is becoming a key resilience metric. Organizations with automated CI/CD for configuration and updates are weathering the storm better than those relying on manual change windows.
