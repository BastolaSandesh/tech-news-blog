Apple has announced the release of a redesigned blood oxygen monitoring feature for Apple Watch users in the US. The update, which will be available later today, will roll out to Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Watch Ultra 2 users through a joint Apple Watch and iPhone software update. To access the revamped feature, users will need to update their devices to iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1. The reworked feature will calculate blood oxygen data on the iPhone, with the resulting data visible in the respiratory section of the Health app.

This development marks a significant milestone in Apple's ongoing legal feud with Masimo, a medical device manufacturer that sued Apple in 2021 for allegedly infringing on its pulse oximeter blood-oxygen monitoring technology patents. The dispute led to a temporary import ban on certain Apple Watch models in the US, forcing Apple to remove the blood oxygen monitoring feature from some devices. However, with this update, Apple has found a way to reintroduce the feature while complying with the patent ruling.

The update will not affect Apple Watch units previously purchased with the original Blood Oxygen feature, nor will it impact devices purchased outside of the US. Apple's decision to redesign the feature and release it as a software update demonstrates the company's commitment to providing innovative health monitoring capabilities to its users while navigating complex patent disputes.


Key takeaways:
- Apple has released a redesigned blood oxygen monitoring feature for US Apple Watch users, available through a software update to iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1.
- The update resolves a long-standing patent dispute with Masimo, allowing Apple to reintroduce the feature while complying with the ruling.
- The reworked feature will calculate blood oxygen data on the iPhone, with results visible in the Health app, and will not affect previously purchased devices or those bought outside the US.
