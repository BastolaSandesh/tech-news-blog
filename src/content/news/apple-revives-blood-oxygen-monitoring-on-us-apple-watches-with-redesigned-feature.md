Apple has announced the rollout of a redesigned blood oxygen monitoring feature on Apple Watches in the US, following a prolonged legal dispute with medical device maker Masimo. The feature, which was previously removed from certain Apple Watch models due to an import ban, will be available on Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Watch Ultra 2 devices through a joint Apple Watch and iPhone update. To access the reworked feature, users will need to update their devices to iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1.

The redesigned feature will calculate blood oxygen data on the iPhone, with the resulting data viewable in the respiratory section of the Health app. This change is a result of Apple's efforts to comply with the US International Trade Commission's (ITC) ruling, which found that Apple had violated Masimo's patents related to pulse oximeter blood-oxygen monitoring technology. The legal feud between Apple and Masimo began in 2021, when Masimo sued Apple for allegedly infringing on its intellectual properties.

The update will not affect Apple Watch units previously purchased with the original Blood Oxygen feature, nor will it impact Apple Watch units purchased outside of the US. This development marks a significant step forward in Apple's ongoing efforts to resolve the dispute with Masimo. With the redesigned feature, Apple Watch users in the US will once again have access to blood oxygen monitoring, a feature that has been available on Apple Watches in other countries.


Key takeaways:
- The redesigned blood oxygen monitoring feature will be available on Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Watch Ultra 2 devices through a joint Apple Watch and iPhone update.
- Users will need to update their devices to iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1 to access the reworked feature, which calculates blood oxygen data on the iPhone.
- The update is a result of Apple's efforts to comply with the US International Trade Commission's ruling, which found that Apple had violated Masimo's patents related to pulse oximeter blood-oxygen monitoring technology.
