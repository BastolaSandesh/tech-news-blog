In a significant development, Apple has reintroduced blood oxygen monitoring to its Apple Watch series in the US, after a temporary removal due to a patent dispute. The feature, which enables users to track their blood oxygen levels, had been absent from Apple Watches sold in the US following a patent infringement lawsuit. However, Apple has now reformulated the technology to circumvent the patent issue, allowing the company to restore this vital health monitoring feature to its wearable devices.

The patent dispute in question stemmed from a lawsuit filed against Apple, alleging that the company's blood oxygen monitoring technology infringed on existing patents. As a result, Apple was forced to remove the feature from Apple Watches sold in the US to avoid further legal repercussions. Nevertheless, the company has been working diligently to redesign the technology and ensure that it no longer infringes on the patents in question.

With the revamped blood oxygen monitoring feature, Apple Watch users in the US can once again track their blood oxygen levels, providing valuable insights into their overall health and wellbeing. This feature is particularly significant for individuals with respiratory conditions, such as asthma or COPD, as it enables them to monitor their blood oxygen levels and take prompt action if necessary.

The return of blood oxygen monitoring to the Apple Watch series is a testament to Apple's commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction. By reformulating the technology to overcome patent hurdles, Apple has demonstrated its ability to adapt and evolve in the face of challenges, ultimately providing users with a more comprehensive and feature-rich wearable device.


Key takeaways:
- Apple has reintroduced blood oxygen monitoring to its Apple Watch series in the US, following a temporary removal due to a patent dispute.
- The revamped feature uses reformulated technology that does not infringe on existing patents, allowing Apple to restore this vital health monitoring feature to its wearable devices.
