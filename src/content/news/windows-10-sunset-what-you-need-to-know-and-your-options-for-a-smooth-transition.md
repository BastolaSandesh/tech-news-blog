Microsoft has announced that it will officially end support for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025, marking the end of an era for the popular operating system. This means that after this date, Windows 10 users will no longer receive customer support, security updates, or any other type of upgrades. While it's technically possible to continue using Windows 10 PCs after the support ends, it's not a recommended course of action. Without security updates, the operating system will become increasingly vulnerable to malware and other security threats, making it a potential liability for users.

For those wondering what this means for their current Windows 10 PC, the good news is that there are options available. The most straightforward solution is to upgrade to Windows 11, which is a free upgrade for Windows 10 users running the latest 22H2 update and meeting the minimum hardware specifications. These specifications include a 1 GHz dual-core 64-bit processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. However, security requirements may pose a challenge for older PCs, as they need to be able to launch in Secure Boot mode and have a TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform 2.0) module.

Upgrading to Windows 11 is a relatively simple process, and it's a great way to ensure that your PC remains secure and supported. Additionally, Windows 11 offers several new features and improvements over Windows 10, making it a worthwhile upgrade for many users. If you're unsure about whether your PC meets the minimum hardware specifications or have questions about the upgrade process, it's a good idea to check Microsoft's website for more information.


Key takeaways:
- Microsoft will end support for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025, after which users will no longer receive security updates or customer support.
- Upgrading to Windows 11 is a free and relatively simple process for Windows 10 users meeting the minimum hardware specifications, including a 1 GHz dual-core 64-bit processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage.
- Users with older PCs may need to consider alternative options, such as purchasing a new PC or exploring other operating systems, if their hardware is not compatible with Windows 11's security requirements.
