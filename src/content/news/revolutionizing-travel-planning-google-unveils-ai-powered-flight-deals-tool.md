Google is taking its artificial intelligence capabilities to new heights with the introduction of Flight Deals, a cutting-edge travel search tool designed to help flexible travelers save money on their next trip. Rolling out in the US, Canada, and India over the next week, this innovative feature is integrated within Google Flights and leverages real-time data to provide users with the best deals available. By utilizing natural language prompts, users can simply inform the AI-powered assistant of their travel intentions, and the tool will scour the internet to find the most cost-effective options.

Unlike traditional travel search methods, which require manual selection of dates, times, and destinations, Flight Deals streamlines the process by taking into account any additional information provided by the user. This means that travelers can enjoy a more personalized and efficient search experience, with the AI-powered tool doing the heavy lifting to identify the best flights and deals from various airlines and booking operators.

As a beta launch, Google plans to use user feedback to refine and improve the capabilities of Flight Deals over time. One of the upcoming features includes the option to exclude basic economy fares in the US and Canada, catering to travelers who prioritize comfort and amenities. To access the Flight Deals tool, users can either visit the dedicated page or select it from the top-left drop-down menu on Google Flights.

By harnessing the power of AI, Google aims to make travel planning more accessible, convenient, and budget-friendly. With Flight Deals, travelers can enjoy a more seamless and personalized experience, allowing them to focus on what matters most â€“ exploring new destinations and creating unforgettable memories.
